At the oral exam of the home exam, any part of the home exam may be examined. All parts of the home exam need to be submitted in one long JNB .ipynb file as well as in .pdf. There will be no (extensive) mathematics in the home exam, apart from perhaps a short formula here or there, but understanding the basics of the mathematics behind cryptography will surely improve your general understanding of the algorithms. Python and Sage can be used to add plots, diagrams and flowcharts to JNB files. You can also add your own drawings to your answers by taking pictures and using the Insert Image command in Markdown cells.\n",

The home exam is individual with individual solutions but working with fellow students is not prohibited. However, if you work with a fellow student, you must mention who you worked with in your answers. For instance: “On questions 2 and 4, I was working together with Carin Keysson”.\n",

During your AES presentation we will look at your code and answers together and you will be asked questions regarding your implementation. You must be able to explain how your code works. If you have had help from others you must comment this in your code. You must comment if you have discussed your code or collaborated with fellow students and comment this for every class/method and give credit to the right person. The same goes if you have looked at code from the internet.\n",
